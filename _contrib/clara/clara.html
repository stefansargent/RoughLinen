<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Purchased Myriad (for bathroom) and Orkney curtain panels (for living room), Orkney natural duvets, and smooth white linen sheets &amp; pillow slips (for master bedroom).  We live on a farm in a very rural, natural area in Oklahoma.  We recently had a major flood that destroyed everything on the inside of our home.  We are still in the process of remodeling.  Rough Linen is perfect for our intended decor!
