<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I pinned the Rough Linen duvet cover to my pinterest wish list over a year ago. Finally, when I got my holiday bonus, I splurged! It was everything I hoped! I love the rough texture and the natural color. Once I had the duvet cover, I knew it was short jump to sheets and pillow cases. I am so happy to have given myself these luxuries! I love getting into bed every night (even more than before...). And I love the look. Every time I wash them, they get softer and softer. Now I'm saving up for a pinafore! ~ Gretchen</font>
