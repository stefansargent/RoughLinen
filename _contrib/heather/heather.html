<font size="2">These shots were taken in my home in Paynesville, Victoria, Australia.
<br /> Paynesville is on the Gippsland Lakes and our home is on the canal, and has a beautiful view of the lakes.
<br /> I love linen and have just purchased Myriad curtains for my guest room, which overlooks the canal. Walking into the guest room and seeing the curtains fills me with great joy. I just love them!
<br /> Here are a few shots of my bedroom, entry, guest room and family room / kitchen. I do hope you like how the curtains look. </font>
