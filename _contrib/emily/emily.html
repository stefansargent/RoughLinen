<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our home is a San Francisco Victorian. I love moving things around and re-purposing found items.The authenticity of Rough Linen is very appealing. I found Rough Linen online and flirted with it for years before buying it. We have the king size Orkney duvet cover and sheets on our bed. It makes bedtime uber indulgent. Thanks Tricia.</font>
