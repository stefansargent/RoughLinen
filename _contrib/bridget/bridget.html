<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hi Tricia
<br /> Arrived home from Africa just before Xmas to my beautiful linen sheet and bed skirt. Suffering from severe jet-lag I cocooned myself in my linen sheet and slept it off over a couple of days, thanks to Rough Linen. Because of time constraints my sheet doubled as the Xmas table cloth and sofa covering which made a change and received lots of compliments.
<br />
<br /> I live in the Rockies in Canada near Osoyoos, British Columbia. It is a semi-arid region with about 70 Boutique Wineries in the vicinity, very good wines!
<br /> Happy New Year and to more purchases of Rough Linen
<br /> Thank You ~ Bridget</font>
