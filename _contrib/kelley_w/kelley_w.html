<br />
<br /> I am a mother of four grown sons. We just bought a family ski home is Sun Valley, Idaho. I love your Rough Linen and filled it with it.
<br />
<br /> This is not the typical Sun Valley cabin. The soft colors with your natural linen really WOWs everyone who has seen it.
<br />
<br /> I love the tranquility of it.
<br />
<br /> Thank You! ~ Kelley Witt</font>
