<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I like to think of my Berkeley, California home as a combination of Tuscan inn and Deco-era Mexican hacienda (if there were such a thing). I've filled it with treasures I have collected from my travels worldwide, but also throughout Northern California.
<br /> I have found that over time I have never regretted the investment that I've made in high-quality bedding. It remains beautiful and serviceable far longer than the cheap stuff, and while it may pinch at the time of purchase, this is forgotten in the years to come. Only the satisfaction remains! ~ bronya</font>
