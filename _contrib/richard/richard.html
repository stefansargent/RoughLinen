<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the master bedroom, the floors are bare and the windows are simple white blackout roller blinds. The king-size summer cover in Orkney natural linen is from Rough Linen.
<br /> My approach to interiors is the same as my approach to product design; simplicity, balance, proportion. I like space and calm, even in small rooms. I prefer interiors that have a relaxed feel, spaces that look cohesive but don&rsquo;t look designed or &lsquo;done&rsquo;; that have a feeling of restraint and quiet. Environments that have a soul and re&#xFB02;ect the owners' personality, objects that mean something, not bought to &#xFB01;ll a gap. When someone asks me to design their home, the collaboration is what&rsquo;s important. I like to &#xFB01;nd out how they live, what they need from their homes, what space and calm and simplicity mean to them.
