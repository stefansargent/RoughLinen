<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bluewater Ranch in Bolinas, California, was remodeled by Mindy Marin, a film industry veteran who uses it as an escape from the pressures of Hollywood.
<br /> &quot;Mindy used beautiful rustic wood. It has a patina and a character you can't find just anywhere. Mindy really let the spirit of the old place come through&quot; says <a href="http://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/27876302/list/7-Supermodel-Homes-and-Why-Creatives-Rent-Them">Cindi Osborn,</a> founder of Mint Locations.

<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Creative directors and stylists love it as a photo shoot location: wide-plank floors, salvaged-wood paneling and a highly textured ceiling give this location a rustic chic aura.
<br /> Agencies and photographers are looking for a place where the design and the architecture are alive in a house.
<br /> A great home communicates something - an alchemy of beauty and a sense of place..&quot;
