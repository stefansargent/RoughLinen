<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I found you on the net and read all your reviews.....I waited several days then ordered on Wednesday and I had my linens on Friday... and I live in Birmingham, Alabama.  I thought the customer service was great, but the linens I put on the bed are even better.  My husband and I love these wonderful sheets. So I thought I would surprise him...and boy was he.
<br /> The linens are just beautiful and just what I was hoping for. Not too much but just perfect.....</font>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have looked for linens with the 'right look'  for ever and did not find, until now, what I was looking for....Shall I  say I want more!  The color, texture, and overall how they feel will be a good night make.</font>
