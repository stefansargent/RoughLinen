<font size="2">I've included some photos of our home. We live in a the small community of Crescent Beach, just south of Vancouver, BC. At one point we had considered moving back to the city but didn't want to leave the beach, which is less that a block away. So, I designed a loft at the beach specially for us. Note: yes the cute little dogs ears are pink, she's a girl, so why not! Her name is Lilly and even though she's not mine…….I adore her and love when she comes to visit.
<br /> Tricia, thanks for offering such a wonderful quality product. The texture of the Orkney linen feels fabulous on your skin and seems to even have a very pleasant perfume. I'm so happy to have something that will only get more and more beautiful every time I wash it. Love, love, love linen!!!!!!!!!!!!
