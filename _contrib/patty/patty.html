<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When we first purchased our home, a former bayman&rsquo;s cottage in a small town on the south shore of Long Island, it had been a bit &ldquo;re-muddled,&rdquo; but, thankfully, had retained its lovely wood floors and my beloved multi-paned and patterned windows.
<br>
<br> Over the years we&rsquo;ve done some tweaking and restoration, adhering to our philosophy of using natural or &ldquo;real&rdquo; materials whenever possible (No vinyl siding here, please!) This probably explains to a degree my affinity for your gorgeous linen items!
<br>
<br> Thanks so much for sharing your beautiful handiwork with all of us! ~ Patty</font>
