<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We live on a lovely lake in southwest Quebec, an hour from Montreal, where we enjoy 3 beautiful seasons. As winters can be quite harsh here, we are very happy to escape to Florida. I have an ongoing love affair with linen, I think 3/4's of my wardrobe is linen, so it was serendipitous when I came upon your website in April. Since then I have made two orders, and am considering doing a bed makeover in my guest room. Your product is truly lovely. Thank you so much. It really suits our home.
