<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We live in northern Ontario, in a house built in 1900.  It was originally a two-up two-down, and has been added to over the years. Still, it remains a small house and we love its simplicity.  We are happiest in a minimal space and very much appreciate the straightforward beauty of Rough Linen.
