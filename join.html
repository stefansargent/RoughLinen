            <div id="join">
                <p>This is where my customers from all over the world get to show off their homes. Send me your house photos with at least four including my Rough Linen products. The others can be your garden, your view - even your bathroom. Every set I post receives a $100 Rough Linen gift voucher.</p>
                <br>
                <p>&bull; I'd like to see the setting, so take wide shots as well as close-ups. I will feature eight photos but you can send as many as you like: table settings with my tablecloth and napkins, rooms with my curtains and, of course, your bedroom linen - for fun, please, please send photos without Rough Linen!</p>
                <br>
                <p>&bull; Tell us about yourself, your house/apartment, where is it, how my products complement it. A story would be nice...</p>
                <br>
                <p>&bull; I can't post all submissions - only those published will receive the $100 gift voucher. You can enter as many times as you like. If selected, I will contact you when posting.</p>
                <br>
                <p>&bull; Make your images at least 1200 x 800 pixels - or higher. Just drag and drop. By submitting photos you agree that they are really yours and we can publish them.</p>
